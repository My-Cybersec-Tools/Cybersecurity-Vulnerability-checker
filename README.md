### ༒︎Cybersecurity-Vulnerability-checker༒︎

> I developed this tool to integrate various scanning functions—such as Nmap, Nikto, and basic vulnerability assessments—into a single script that you can use on any website or IP address.

### Tool Functionality :

> 1.Port Scanning using Nmap 
> 2.Web Server Vulnerability Scanning using Nikto
> 3.SSL/TLS Configuration Check using Nmap.

### What the Script Does :

> 1.Nmap Scan: Performs a basic port scan and service detection using Nmap
> 2.Nikto Scan: If the target is a web server, it checks for known vulnerabilities
> 3.SSL/TLS Configuration: Checks for weak or insecure SSL/TLS configurations (common for HTTPS websites)
> 4.Searchsploit Scan (optional): Uses Searchsploit to look for known exploits in software running on the target.
