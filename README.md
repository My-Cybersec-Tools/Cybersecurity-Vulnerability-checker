I developed this tool to integrate various scanning functions—such as Nmap, Nikto, and basic vulnerability assessments—into a single script that you can use on any website or IP address.
I will not be responsible for any misuse of this tool.
Tool Functionality:
1.Port Scanning using Nmap
2.Web Server Vulnerability Scanning using Nikto
3.SSL/TLS Configuration Check using Nmap

What the Script Does:
1.Nmap Scan: Performs a basic port scan and service detection using Nmap.
2.Nikto Scan: If the target is a web server, it checks for known vulnerabilities.
3.SSL/TLS Configuration: Checks for weak or insecure SSL/TLS configurations (common for HTTPS websites).
4.Searchsploit Scan (optional): Uses Searchsploit to look for known exploits in software running on the target.
